# Boilerplate for Github Crawler

This is a boilerplate for a Github Crawler. It is a simple example of how to use the Github API to get information about a repository.

Note! You will need to create a .env file with your Github API token. You can create a token by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
